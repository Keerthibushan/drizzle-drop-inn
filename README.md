## üíª Tech Stack

This project is built using standard web technologies.

* **HTML**: Provides the structure and content for each page.
* **CSS**: Styles the website with custom layouts and a modern aesthetic. Key styles are split between `styles.css` for general design and `room-styles.css` for room-specific layouts and the booking modal.
* **JavaScript**: Powers interactive elements like the responsive navigation menu and the booking modal's functionality.

### How the Booking Modal Works

Our booking modal is a key interactive feature. It's powered by `room-script.js` and performs several functions:

1.  **Opens and Closes**: It opens on a button click and closes when you click outside of it or on the close button.
2.  **Calculates Price**: It calculates the total cost of your stay based on the number of nights selected. For example, the **Deluxe Double Room** is priced at ‚Çπ1,718 per night, and the **Family Room** is ‚Çπ1,964 per night.
3.  **Validates Form Data**: Before confirming, the script checks if the dates, name, email, and phone number are valid.
4.  **Simulates Booking**: The form submission is a simulation. It stores a booking confirmation in your browser's local storage and displays a success message with a unique booking ID.
